# Comments Practice

## UI Pieces

- list of comments [ ]
   - comment includes [ ]
      - profile image placeholder [ x ]
      - actual profile image [ ]
         - upload box to upload image [  ]
      - user name [ x ]
      - edit button [ x ]
      - delete button [ x ]
         - does the delete button delete the item in the list of comments or does it just delete the comment part? I made it so it deletes the whole entry.
      - actual comment [ x ]
      - input to edit comment [ x ]
      - submit button [ x ]
- comment input piece [ x ]
   - display name input [ x ]
   - comment input [ x ]
